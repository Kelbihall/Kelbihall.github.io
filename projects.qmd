# Lab Projects

Welcome to my RStudio project portfolio! Here’s what I’ve learned from each of the 11 labs in ESS 330 (Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science)

### Lab 1: Intro to GitHub Pages

In this lab, I created my own personal website using Quarto and GitHub Pages. I learned how to structure a `.qmd` file, edit the YAML header, and deploy content to a live site.

***This is the Website you're looking at now!***

**Reflection:**

This lab helped me set the foundation for sharing my work publicly. It was empowering to build a site from scratch and understand how version control works through GitHub.

### Lab 2: Spatial Thinking and Elevation

I explored digital elevation data by importing a raster file and analyzing the terrain of Fort Collins. I used R to calculate elevation statistics and visualize patterns in topography.

**Reflection:**\
I gained confidence working with raster data and learned how to extract meaningful information from elevation layers using `terra` and `ggplot`.

### Lab 3: Raster Histograms and Visualization

This lab focused on raster visualization techniques. I learned how to classify elevation data into bins and use color gradients and hillshade to enhance interpretation.

**Reflection:**\

This lab pushed me to think critically about how data visualization choices impact how geographic patterns are understood.

### Lab 4: Raster Math and Units

I performed raster calculations including unit conversions from centimeters to feet and learned how to rescale data to different formats and magnitudes.

**Reflection:**\

It was helpful to manipulate elevation data directly and explore how raster math can inform environmental analysis.

### Lab 5: Project Proposals 

In this lab, I developed a formal proposal for my final course project. I selected a research question related to environmental data analysis, identified a relevant dataset, and outlined the methods I planned to use.

**Reflection:**

This lab gave me the opportunity to connect my interests in sustainability and data science through research. It helped me organize my thoughts, clarify my goals, and build a roadmap for completing a meaningful and structured final analysis.

### Lab 6: Machine Learning with CAMELS

I used the CAMELS dataset to predict mean streamflow (`q_mean`) using an XGBoost model. This included cleaning data, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating predictions.

**Reflection:**\
This was my first time implementing a full machine learning workflow. I learned how important clean data and model tuning are for accurate environmental predictions.

### Lab 7: Final Project Intro and Methods

We set up our final project as a collaborative Quarto manuscript linked to GitHub. As a team, we drafted our introduction, explored the dataset, created visualizations, and outlined initial methods and challenges.

**Reflection:**\
This lab helped us move from planning to action. It clarified our goals, revealed early data issues, and gave us a solid foundation to build our final analysis.

### Lab 8: Modeling and Mapping Predictions

I mapped XGBoost model predictions across the CONUS region using geospatial tools. I also evaluated model accuracy using spatial cross-validation.

**Reflection:**\
It was exciting to see model outputs visualized across a real geographic scale. This helped me connect statistical modeling with spatial insight.

### Lab 9:  Project Introduction, Data, Methods

We expanded our final project by drafting the methods, results, and discussion sections. We organized our analysis into written form, shared key findings through visualizations, and reflected on the significance and limitations of our results.

**Reflection:**

This lab helped translate our technical work into clear communication. Writing out the methods and results clarified what we had accomplished and what questions still remained.\

### Lab 10: Distance from the Border Zone

I analyzed spatial proximity to the U.S. border zone and explored how distance calculations are used in policy and surveillance contexts.

![](img/10.png){width="518"}

**Reflection:**\
This lab was a great example of how spatial analysis applies to real policy issues. It challenged me to think critically about data and ethics.

### Lab 11: Final Project Presentation

My team delivered a 7-minute lightning talk summarizing our final research project. We presented the background, research question, key results, and conclusions, supported by two core visualizations. We focused on communicating our methods and findings clearly and concisely.

**Reflection:**\
This talk was a great exercise in science communication. Condensing a full analysis into a short presentation pushed us to focus on what really mattered and helped us practice explaining technical work to a broader audience.got a
