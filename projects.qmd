# Lab Projects

Welcome to my RStudio project portfolio! Here’s what I’ve learned from each of the 11 labs in ESS 330 (Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science)

### Lab 1: Intro to GitHub Pages

In this lab, I created my own personal website using Quarto and GitHub Pages. I learned how to structure a `.qmd` file, edit the YAML header, and deploy content to a live site.

**Reflection:**\

This lab helped me set the foundation for sharing my work publicly. It was empowering to build a site from scratch and understand how version control works through GitHub.

### Lab 2: Spatial Thinking and Elevation

I explored digital elevation data by importing a raster file and analyzing the terrain of Fort Collins. I used R to calculate elevation statistics and visualize patterns in topography.

**Reflection:**\

I gained confidence working with raster data and learned how to extract meaningful information from elevation layers using `terra` and `ggplot`.

### Lab 3: Raster Histograms and Visualization

This lab focused on raster visualization techniques. I learned how to classify elevation data into bins and use color gradients and hillshade to enhance interpretation.

**Reflection:**\

This lab pushed me to think critically about how data visualization choices impact how geographic patterns are understood.

### Lab 4: Raster Math and Units

I performed raster calculations including unit conversions from centimeters to feet and learned how to rescale data to different formats and magnitudes.

**Reflection:**\

It was helpful to manipulate elevation data directly and explore how raster math can inform environmental analysis.

### Lab 5: Raster Reprojection and Cropping

In this lab, I developed a formal proposal for my final course project. I selected a research question related to environmental data analysis, identified a relevant dataset, and outlined the methods I planned to use.

**Reflection:**

This lab gave me the opportunity to connect my interests in sustainability and data science through a real-world research lens. It helped me organize my thoughts, clarify my goals, and build a roadmap for completing a meaningful and structured final analysis.

### Lab 6: Machine Learning with CAMELS

I used the CAMELS dataset to predict mean streamflow (`q_mean`) using an XGBoost model. This included cleaning data, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating predictions.

**Reflection:**\

This was my first time implementing a full machine learning workflow. I learned how important clean data and model tuning are for accurate environmental predictions.

### Lab 7: Data Cleaning with CAMELS

Building off Lab 6, I performed deeper data cleaning, handled missing values, and examined data distributions to prepare for more robust modeling.

**Reflection:**\
This lab taught me how to recognize and handle messy environmental data and the value of preprocessing in any analysis pipeline.

### Lab 8: Modeling and Mapping Predictions

I mapped XGBoost model predictions across the CONUS region using geospatial tools. I also evaluated model accuracy using spatial cross-validation.

**Reflection:**\
It was exciting to see model outputs visualized across a real geographic scale. This helped me connect statistical modeling with spatial insight.

### Lab 9: County Level Population and Land Use

I joined raster and vector data to explore land cover and population distributions. I used spatial joins to identify intersections between counties and land cover types.

**Reflection:**\

This lab improved my skills working with multiple spatial data types and set the stage for real-world environmental planning.

### Lab 10: Distance from the Border Zone

I analyzed spatial proximity to the U.S. border zone and explored how distance calculations are used in policy and surveillance contexts.

**Reflection:**\
This lab was a great example of how spatial analysis applies to real policy issues. It challenged me to think critically about data and ethics.

### Lab 11: River Profile of the Cache la Poudre

I extracted a river profile using OpenStreetMap and DEM data, calculated the river's slope and sinuosity, and plotted its elevation profile.

**Reflection:**\
This final lab brought everything full circle—from raster handling to vector analysis. It was a great capstone to demonstrate what I’ve learned this semester.
