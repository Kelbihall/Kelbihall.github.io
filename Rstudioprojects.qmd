# Lab Projects

Welcome to my RStudio project portfolio! Here’s what I’ve learned from each of the 11 labs in ESS 330 (Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science)

### Lab 1: Intro to GitHub Pages

In this lab, I created my own personal website using Quarto and GitHub Pages. I learned how to structure a `.qmd` file, edit the YAML header, and deploy content to a live site.

**Reflection:**\

This lab helped me set the foundation for sharing my work publicly. It was empowering to build a site from scratch and understand how version control works through GitHub.

### **Lab 2: Minnesota tree growth**

Manipulating and summarizing data with dplyr explored digital elevation data by importing a raster file and analyzing the terrain of Fort Collins. I used R to calculate elevation statistics and visualize patterns in topography.

## Lab 2: Manipulating and summarizing data with dplyr

Here’s a snapshot of the raw data before cleaning:

Rows: 131,386
Columns: 8
$ treeID  <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …
$ standID <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …
$ stand   <chr> "A1", "A1", "A1", "A1", "A1", "A1", "A1…
$ year    <int> 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 196…
$ species <chr> "ABBA", "ABBA", "ABBA", "ABBA", "ABBA",…
$ age     <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, …
$ inc     <dbl> 0.930, 0.950, 0.985, 0.985, 0.715, 0.84…


After cleaning and transforming the data, I was able to calculate tree diameter (DBH), basal area (BA), and categorize trees into DBH classes. I also used summary statistics to analyze growth patterns by species and over time.

**Reflection:**\
This lab taught me how to use `dplyr` to clean and summarize a large dataset efficiently. It gave me a strong foundation in data wrangling—filtering, grouping, and creating new variables—all essential for ecological analysis.

**Reflection:** This lab taught me how to filter, transform, and summarize large ecological datasets using `dplyr`. I used functions like `mutate()`, `case_when()`, and `group_by()` to derive insights like tree basal area and size class.

### Lab 3: Raster Histograms and Visualization

This lab focused on raster visualization techniques. I learned how to classify elevation data into bins and use color gradients and hillshade to enhance interpretation.

**Reflection:**\

This lab pushed me to think critically about how data visualization choices impact how geographic patterns are understood.

### Lab 4: Raster Math and Units

I performed raster calculations including unit conversions from centimeters to feet and learned how to rescale data to different formats and magnitudes.

**Reflection:**\

It was helpful to manipulate elevation data directly and explore how raster math can inform environmental analysis.

### Lab 5: Raster Reprojection and Cropping

In this lab, I used `AOI` and `USAboundaries` to crop and reproject spatial data. I learned how coordinate reference systems affect spatial analysis.

**Reflection:**\

This lab deepened my understanding of projections and how critical they are when aligning spatial data from different sources.

### Lab 6: Machine Learning with CAMELS

I used the CAMELS dataset to predict mean streamflow (`q_mean`) using an XGBoost model. This included cleaning data, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating predictions.

**Reflection:**\

This was my first time implementing a full machine learning workflow. I learned how important clean data and model tuning are for accurate environmental predictions.

### Lab 7: Data Cleaning with CAMELS

Building off Lab 6, I performed deeper data cleaning, handled missing values, and examined data distributions to prepare for more robust modeling.

**Reflection:**\

This lab taught me how to recognize and handle messy environmental data and the value of preprocessing in any analysis pipeline.

### Lab 8: Modeling and Mapping Predictions

I mapped XGBoost model predictions across the CONUS region using geospatial tools. I also evaluated model accuracy using spatial cross-validation.

**Reflection:**\

It was exciting to see model outputs visualized across a real geographic scale. This helped me connect statistical modeling with spatial insight.

### Lab 9: County-Level Population and Land Use

I joined raster and vector data to explore land cover and population distributions. I used spatial joins to identify intersections between counties and land cover types.

**Reflection:**\

This lab improved my skills working with multiple spatial data types and set the stage for real-world environmental planning.

### Lab 10: Distance from the Border Zone

I analyzed spatial proximity to the U.S. border zone and explored how distance calculations are used in policy and surveillance contexts.

**Reflection:**\

This lab was a great example of how spatial analysis applies to real policy issues. It challenged me to think critically about data and ethics.

### Lab 11: River Profile of the Cache la Poudre

I extracted a river profile using OpenStreetMap and DEM data, calculated the river's slope and sinuosity, and plotted its elevation profile.

**Reflection:**\

This final lab brought everything full circle—from raster handling to vector analysis. It was a great capstone to demonstrate what I’ve learned this semester.
