    "text": "Welcome to my RStudio project portfolio! Here’s what I’ve learned from each of the 11 labs in ESS 330 (Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science)\n\n\nIn this lab, I created my own personal website using Quarto and GitHub Pages. I learned how to structure a .qmd file, edit the YAML header, and deploy content to a live site.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab helped me set the foundation for sharing my work publicly. It was empowering to build a site from scratch and understand how version control works through GitHub.\n\n\n\nManipulating and summarizing data with dplyr explored digital elevation data by importing a raster file and analyzing the terrain of Fort Collins. I used R to calculate elevation statistics and visualize patterns in topography.\n\n\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the raw data before cleaning:\nRows: 131,386 Columns: 8 $ treeID  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, … $ standID  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, … $ stand  “A1”, “A1”, “A1”, “A1”, “A1”, “A1”, “A1… $ year  1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 196… $ species ”ABBA”, “ABBA”, “ABBA”, “ABBA”, “ABBA”,… $ age  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, … $ inc  0.930, 0.950, 0.985, 0.985, 0.715, 0.84…\nAfter cleaning and transforming the data, I was able to calculate tree diameter (DBH), basal area (BA), and categorize trees into DBH classes. I also used summary statistics to analyze growth patterns by species and over time.\nReflection:\nThis lab taught me how to use dplyr to clean and summarize a large dataset efficiently. It gave me a strong foundation in data wrangling—filtering, grouping, and creating new variables—all essential for ecological analysis.\n\nReflection: This lab taught me how to filter, transform, and summarize large ecological datasets using dplyr. I used functions like mutate(), case_when(), and group_by() to derive insights like tree basal area and size class.\n\n\nThis lab focused on raster visualization techniques. I learned how to classify elevation data into bins and use color gradients and hillshade to enhance interpretation.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab pushed me to think critically about how data visualization choices impact how geographic patterns are understood.\n\n\n\nI performed raster calculations including unit conversions from centimeters to feet and learned how to rescale data to different formats and magnitudes.\nReflection:\n\nIt was helpful to manipulate elevation data directly and explore how raster math can inform environmental analysis.\n\n\n\nIn this lab, I used AOI and USAboundaries to crop and reproject spatial data. I learned how coordinate reference systems affect spatial analysis.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab deepened my understanding of projections and how critical they are when aligning spatial data from different sources.\n\n\n\nI used the CAMELS dataset to predict mean streamflow (q_mean) using an XGBoost model. This included cleaning data, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating predictions.\nReflection:\n\nThis was my first time implementing a full machine learning workflow. I learned how important clean data and model tuning are for accurate environmental predictions.\n\n\n\nBuilding off Lab 6, I performed deeper data cleaning, handled missing values, and examined data distributions to prepare for more robust modeling.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab taught me how to recognize and handle messy environmental data and the value of preprocessing in any analysis pipeline.\n\n\n\nI mapped XGBoost model predictions across the CONUS region using geospatial tools. I also evaluated model accuracy using spatial cross-validation.\nReflection:\n\nIt was exciting to see model outputs visualized across a real geographic scale. This helped me connect statistical modeling with spatial insight.\n\n\n\nI joined raster and vector data to explore land cover and population distributions. I used spatial joins to identify intersections between counties and land cover types.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab improved my skills working with multiple spatial data types and set the stage for real-world environmental planning.\n\n\n\nI analyzed spatial proximity to the U.S. border zone and explored how distance calculations are used in policy and surveillance contexts.\nReflection:\n\nThis lab was a great example of how spatial analysis applies to real policy issues. It challenged me to think critically about data and ethics.\n\n\n\nI extracted a river profile using OpenStreetMap and DEM data, calculated the river’s slope and sinuosity, and plotted its elevation profile.\nReflection:\n\nThis final lab brought everything full circle—from raster handling to vector analysis. It was a great capstone to demonstrate what I’ve learned this semester."
